 *
 *  A browser build is the workload where model quality shows up most — it is

 *  the whole first project, which 51% of Web users never come back from. The
 *  Pro 08/13 GA build is the strongest agentic model in this catalog, which is

 *
 *  ONE KNOWN COST OF THIS CHOICE, deliberate rather than overlooked: Pro is
 *  `dataUse: 'training'` while Luna was `service`, so the model a brand-new user
 *  lands on now DOES carry the AI-training notice. Every picker already renders
 *  `warning` for the default, so it is disclosed — but it is a real change to

 *
 *  Spend is NOT among the costs, which is why this is not the extravagant choice
 *  it looks like next to Luna's headline $0.10 input: browser turns re-send their

 *  cache at $0.003625/M against Luna's $0.010/M. See

 *  the model selector coerces a spent default) — otherwise the default becomes

 *
 *  This tracks the models Flash superseded — costing more per token AND having
 *  lost the quality argument — so muting them is what steers new picks to Flash.
 *  Both halves of that test have to hold: DeepSeek V4 Pro left this list on
 *  2026-08-12 because its 08/13 GA build wins the quality half again.

 *  Muting only pays for itself on a group of rows, so add entries back in
 *  pairs or not at all.
 *
 *  GPT-5.6 Luna is superseded (by Pro) and deliberately NOT muted, because the

 *
 *  Pro is 2.76x CHEAPER on cache reads — the term that dominates an agent
 *  workload, where re-sent prefixes are ~98% of tokens — while being 4.35x
 *  dearer on fresh input and 1.45x dearer on output. Break-even on the input
