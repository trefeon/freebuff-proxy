 * harness is spending our inference budget; serving them a free model spends
 * none of it. `getChatCompletionsProvider` has no branch for this slug and
 * falls through to `openrouter`, so nothing else needs to know about it.
 *
 * Verified against the OpenRouter catalog on 2026-08-08: 262k context, $0
 * prompt and completion, and `tools` + `tool_choice` in supported_parameters —
 * so a downgraded tool-calling request degrades rather than hard-erroring.

 *    `base2-free-deepseek-flash` classify under that signal instead. Neither
 *    enforces, so the reclassification changes measurement, not behavior.
 *  - `root_agent_no_tools` — 3,729 users who also do real agentic work, 999 of
 *    whose sessions mix it with tool-bearing root calls. See the backtest in
 *    `detectForeignFreebuffClient`. Catching the 417 genuine proxies inside
