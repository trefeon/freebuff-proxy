 *  - IT IS FREE, AND THAT IS FENCED RATHER THAN TRUSTED — see

 *    all, so an unnoticed repricing would be unmetered spend.
 *  - REASONING IS MANDATORY (the endpoint reports `reasoning.mandatory`), and
 *    the provider's own default effort is `max`. Measured on one debugging
 *    prompt, n=4 per rung, 2026-08-20: `low` answered correctly in 409
 *    completion tokens and 8.4s, `high` in 725 and 11.3s, `max` in 3,505 and
 *    48.5s — with one of the four `max` samples truncated by a 4k token limit
 *    mid-answer. So the row names its effort explicitly; leaving it unset opts
 *    every turn into the slowest and most truncation-prone rung there is.
 *  - Prompts and completions are RETAINED BY THE HOST and, per OpenRouter's
 *    stealth-model terms, not used for training. That is neither case

 *
 * The Merge Gateway DECLARES three values for this model
 * (`effort_values: ["low","high","max"]`), which is also a subset of
 * OpenRouter's enum and passes through CrofAI verbatim, so all three rungs of
 * the cascade mean the same thing and a divert cannot silently change depth
 * (see MERGE_VENDOR_ORDER for how often diverts happen). `max` is therefore
 * available on every lane; it is withheld here as a PRODUCT decision, not a
 * capability one.
 *
 * `max` WAS OFFERED AND WAS REMOVED ON 2026-08-31, because at that depth this
 * model does not converge on agent work: it re-reads the same files, re-plans
 * the same step and re-issues tool calls it has already made, until the turn is
 * spent on deliberation rather than edits. Depth past `high` is not free on a
 * harness that feeds every thought back into the next step's prompt.
 *
 * REMOVING THE RUNG IS ONLY HALF THE FIX, and the other half is the reason this
 * row now also carries `reasoningEffort: 'high'`. Measured in thinking
 * characters on a prompt that needs reasoning (2026-08-27, recorded in
 * merge-gateway.ts):
 *
 *   low 107  <  high 175  <  max 590  <  unset 708
 *
 * and again on an agent-shaped refactor prompt, three samples each (2026-08-29):
 *
 *   unset  8118 / 9942 / 9871      max  7271 / 8011 / 5781
 *
 * UNSET IS DEEPER THAN `max`. Unset is what this row sent on every untouched
 * turn from launch until 2026-08-31 — no `reasoningEffort` meant
 * `applyFreebuffReasoningDefaults` sent no effort at all — so the looping
 * setting was ALSO the default one, and the majority of turns never went near
 * the picker. Deleting the rung while leaving the wire default unset would have
 * taken the control away from the few users who could already see the problem
 * and left it running for everyone else. Hence the pin.
 *
 * (A short logic puzzle REVERSES the unset/max ordering — unset 649, max 1356 —
 * so no single sample is the ordering. What survives repetition is that unset
 * and max are both far above `high` on real agent turns, which is all this
 * needs.)
 *
 * `low` EMITS NO THINKING TRACE AT ALL — 0 chars on both vendors, measured
 * 2026-08-29, while still answering normally. That is the rung behaving as
 * named, not a fault, but it means a user who picks `low` sees the thinking
 * blocks disappear entirely rather than merely shorten. Expect it to be
 * reported as a bug at least once.
 *
 * `none` is deliberately absent and must never be added: the model declares
 * `disable_supported: false`, and the undeclared `'none'` measures at 732 —
 * MORE thinking than unset, the exact opposite of what it names.
 *
 * NOT a change to what BYOK and direct-API callers may send. MERGE_EFFORT_ALIASES
 * still maps OpenRouter's wider enum onto the gateway's declared three, `max`
 * included: a caller paying their own bill keeps the rung. This list governs
 * what Freebuff itself picks and offers.
 *
 * `max` IS BACK (2026-09-01, evening), and it is the ONLY rung on which this
 * model thinks at all. Measured with agent tools in the body, thinking
 * characters, two samples per cell, same prompt as the reasoning monitor:
 *
 *              low       high        xhigh      max              unset
 *   zai        0 / 40    229 / 538   157 / 277  7,282 / 9,104    12,272 / 16,652
 *   particle   0 / 26    178 / 447   262 / 296  5,506 / 6,729    237 / 255
 *   OpenRouter          49 tok      78 tok     2,381 tok        1,814 tok
 *
 * `high` had measured 2-4k on particle on 2026-08-31; by the next evening it
 * was ~300 characters on both vendors, and `xhigh` is `high` under another
 * name on Z.ai's side. Nothing in between exists: OpenRouter's reasoning
 * token budget is ignored and the native `thinking` parameter switches
 * thinking OFF. So the ladder is none / almost-none / deep, and a "Deep
 * reasoning" row that never reaches the third rung is mislabelled. On the
 * tool-bearing mini-bench `max` scored 10/10 at ~614 reasoning tokens against
 * 8/10 at ~15 for `high`, at 21s median latency against 9s.
 *
 * The looping that removed the rung (#2528) is real and is the trade being
 * made here on purpose: depth over the loop risk, with the wire default
 * moving to `max` in the same change. Watch tool-call repetition per turn.

  // on Luminal — which is not DeepSeek and so has no peak surcharge at all —
  // cheaper than both by ~4x (~8x at the hour peak pricing begins, same model,

  // but removing a model from the premium lists is not:
  // FREEBUFF_STANDARD_MODEL_IDS is derived by filtering `!premium`, so a
  // premium model absent from every pool becomes UNLIMITED rather than
  // stricter. Dropping the cap changes which pool meters this row, never
  // whether one does.
  //
  // SOLAR PRO 4 held the one entry from 2026-08-31 to 2026-09-01, at ONE a
  // day — the same measurement window GLM 5.3 Flash got, and it closed after a
  // day for a reason none of the earlier windows had.
  //
  // The row shipped to every surface on 2026-08-28 with no cap, and on 08-31
  // its recorded daily spend multiplied by roughly seventy inside fourteen
  // hours, to the joint most expensive row per message we served. The cap was
  // a response to that figure — and the figure was wrong by an order of
  // magnitude. The route is BYOK and the ledger was recording OpenRouter's
  // estimate at Upstage's list card, while Upstage was invoicing us at its
  // launch promo, one tenth of it (see the PRICE note on
  // FREEBUFF_SOLAR_PRO_4_MODEL_ID). Corrected, the row sits with the cheaper
  // premium rows, so the window closed on 09-01 and the shared premium pool
  // meters it alone — which, per the invariant below, is a change of pool and
  // not a change of whether one applies.
  //
  // What remains: the per-SESSION dollar ceiling in
  // FREEBUFF_PER_MODEL_SESSION_SPEND_CAPS, which at the corrected rate is a
  // bound on the tail rather than a wall after a few prompts. Two things about
  // the row are still not measured and would justify re-adding an entry here:
  // its cache rate on the single pinned endpoint (the 08-31 figure was two
  // endpoints' worth, and the day the cap ran truncated every session too
  // short to warm), and its cost at LIST once the promo ends on 2026-09-10 UTC.

 *  were written for the GLM 5.3 Flash default of 2026-08-30 and still hold.
 *
 *  THE FIRST DEFAULT SINCE 2026-08-18 THAT IS NOT PREMIUM, and that is the
 *  substantive change rather than a detail. Every default in between drew on the
 *  shared daily pool, which made a step-down mandatory for anything holding a

 *  availableFreebuffDefault — because otherwise the recommended pick became a
 *  model whose next send fails admission. That machinery all still exists and
 *  still serves the limited tier, but it is no longer load-bearing here: this
 *  row is unmetered and uncapped, so a new user's first send cannot fail for
 *  want of quota.
 *
 *  It is also `availability: 'always'` and the cheapest row we serve
 *  (measured per-message, 4.6x under MiMo and 8.9x under V4 Flash). The cost
 *  and availability arguments are therefore both strictly better than the Luna
 *  it replaces. Latency used to be the argument it LOST, while it ran unset on
 *  the wire; since 2026-08-31 it is pinned to `high` (see
 *  GLM_V53_FLASH_REASONING_EFFORTS for why) and that gap is closed.
 *
 *  Still three separate constants: this one, DEFAULT_FREEBUFF_WEB_MODEL_ID and
 *  FALLBACK_FREEBUFF_MODEL_ID (what callers needing a guaranteed-available id
 *  for resolution / auto-fallbacks should use). The first two name the same
 *  model today and have diverged before; the third is genuinely a different
 *  model rather than the same one under two names.
 *
 *  Unlike the Luna and Flash defaults before it, this row carries NO
 *  AI-training notice (`dataUse: 'service'`), so the disclosure a first-time
 *  user sees changes — pickers still render `warning`, there is simply no
 *  longer one to render on the default row. */

 *
 *  The browser surfaces are where this default matters most and where the trade
 *  cuts both ways hardest. A browser build is one long agentic run against a
 *  live sandbox, where a wrong turn early costs the whole first project — and
 *  51% of Web users never come back from a failed one. That argument has always
 *  favoured the deepest row available, and this IS the deep row, which is the
 *  case for it here.
 *
 *  Against that: browser turns re-send their whole prefix every step, so these
 *  surfaces are the most latency-sensitive we have, and preparation already
 *  costs ~6.3s at p50 before a token (docs/freebuff-ttft-deferred-vm.md). The
 *  deep default this comment expected to have to walk back HAS been walked back
 *  — the row was pinned to `high` on 2026-08-31, for looping rather than for
 *  latency (see GLM_V53_FLASH_REASONING_EFFORTS) — so the per-step reasoning
 *  cost this paragraph warned about is already paid down. If first-run
 *  completion still moves the wrong way, the next lever is a different model,
 *  not a lower rung.
 *

 *  row's list cache-read rate is nearly double Luna's — but measured per
 *  message on the traffic that actually runs it bills an order of magnitude
 *  LESS than Luna (figures in the internal cost notes, not here).

 *  dearer off-peak and 4.4x dearer at peak, and it was already dearer on fresh

 * request a browser turn cannot. So the fence here is the one the model
 * actually needs. Kimi K3 Eco stays off the list: it is god-gated on its own.
 *
 * Enforced in web/src/app/api/v1/chat/completions/_post.ts, next to the
